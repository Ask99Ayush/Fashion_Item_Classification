Fashion Item Classification Report This project focuses on classifying images of fashion items using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels divided into 10 categories such as T-shirts, trousers, and ankle boots. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

The project workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: Normalizing pixel values to improve model training efficiency.

Model Selection: Implementing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify the best classifier.

Training: Feeding the preprocessed training data into the model to learn distinguishing features of each fashion class.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance on the test set using accuracy and confusion matrices.

Results & Analysis: Comparing different modelsâ€™ accuracies and discussing challenges faced, such as class imbalance and misclassification among visually similar items
